## v1.0.0 â€“ Initial release

After about a year of development, _phoenix_ released version `1.0.0` in October 2022. After replacing
[Try/ZenLib](https://github.com/Try/ZenLib) which was forked from [ataulien/ZenLib](https://github.com/ataulien/ZenLib)
in the _Gothic_ engine re-implementation [OpenGothic](https://github.com/Try/OpenGothic) and a bit more than 500
commits, _phoenix_ has finally reached a point at which I would consider it to be stable enough to make a full release.

Thanks to everyone who helped test the implementation in [OpenGothic#271](https://github.com/Try/OpenGothic/pull/271).
I want to especially thank [@Try](https://github.com/Try) for allowing me to integrate into
[OpenGothic](https://github.com/Try/OpenGothic)! It really helped motivate me to keep working on _phoenix_ and to make
it better!
