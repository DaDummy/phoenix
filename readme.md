The _phoenix_ project aims to re-implement the _ZenGin_ made by [Piranha Bytes](https://www.piranha-bytes.com/) for their early-2000s games [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(video_game)) and [Gothic II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_II). It is heavily based on [ZenLib](https://github.com/Try/ZenLib) which is used as a reference implementation for the different file formats used.
